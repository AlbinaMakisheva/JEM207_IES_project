            This project focuses on analyzing the impact of key events on stock prices using event-driven analysis. 
            We examine the relationship between the global COVID-19 pandemic and the stock prices of Pfizer Inc. 
            by investigating the impact of significant events, such as the WHO declaring a pandemic and the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
            
            The project involves multiple types of analyses:
            - **Regression Analysis:** We perform multiple linear regression to understand the relationships between stock prices and COVID-related variables.
            - **Event Impact Analysis:** We assess the direct impact of major events on stock returns.
            - **Logistic Regression:** We build models to classify stock movements and identify important features.

            The datasets used in this analysis include global COVID-19 case data and stock price data for Pfizer. These datasets are combined to enable the analysis of event-driven changes in stock behavior.

            - **WHO Declares Pandemic (March 2020)**: Pfizer's stock initially experienced **volatility**, showing no immediate uptrend.
            - **First Vaccine Approval (December 2020)**: The stock **rallied significantly**, possibly indicating investor confidence in vaccine-driven revenue.
            - **Vaccination Threshold Reached (July 2021)**: The stock peaked, likely due to strong vaccine sales expectations.

                Given the high correlation in most of our variables and the caracteristics of our analysis, we decided to create lag variables. Lag variables account for the time delay between a predictor variable and its effect on the dependent variable (stock returns). We believe that this is highly relevant for variables like vaccinations that take time to impact COVID-19 metrics which in turn may influence Pfizer's stock performance. For highly autocorrelated variables, their lagged values might add predictive power.

                Given this, we also decided to separate the variables to account for the time it would take to impact the outcome. Long lags (3-6 months) might be helpful for variables like gdp_per_capita, stringency_index, vaccination rates, or vaccination signals, as their effects are often gradual. Variables like new_cases and new_deaths typically have shorter lags (e.g., 1â€“2 weeks) since the market reacts quickly to changes in pandemic severity.

                    For the first regression, there is a noticeable clustering of residuals at certain ranges of fitted values. This indicates potential issues with heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) or omitted variable bias.
                    For the second regression, the residuals display a strong pattern,  which could be understood as a sign of heteroscedasticity.The variance of residuals increases with higher fitted values, indicating that the model struggles to capture variability at those levels.
                    In summary, through graphical visualization, the residuals appear to increase, indicating that they are not constant over time.
                    
                    Regarding the Distribution of Residuals, the residuals of both regressions are approximately normal but have visible tails or are slightly skewed. This indicates a reasonable fit but with room for improvement in capturing the underlying patterns.
                    Given this, and to improve our regressions, we should apply the necessary corrections in order to restore the classical assumption of constant variance. It is also important to highlight that these procedures, while not fully resolving the problem of heteroscedasticity, restore the validity of statistical inference in large samples.

This could reflect investor expectations of higher vaccine demand benefiting Pfizer.
                               
                    > new_deaths_smoothed_diff_lag_1: A negative effect, meaning that an increase in deaths (with a 1-day lag) slightly decreases the probability of stock rising.

                    > new_vaccinations_smoothed_diff_lag_180: No significant effect on stock movement. This implies that long-term vaccination trends are already priced into the market and do not directly influence short-term stock price changes.
                     
                    > Dummy_Variable_diff_lag_180: A negative effect, meaning that the event dummy variable (with a 180-day lag) reduces the probability of stock increase. This suggests that major pandemic-related events (such as lockdowns or vaccine rollouts) tend to have a negative impact over the long term.
                     
                    > deaths_to_cases_ratio: A negative effect, meaning that a higher ratio of deaths to cases reduces the probability of stock price increase. This indicates that severe pandemic conditions negatively impact investor confidence.
                    
                    > interaction_term: Strongest positive effect, meaning that the interaction between new cases and the dummy variable significantly increases the probability of stock rising. This could imply that stock price increases are most likely in response to rising cases during specific pandemic events (e.g., vaccine approvals or policy changes).
