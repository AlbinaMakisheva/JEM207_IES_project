        This project focuses on analyzing the impact of key events on stock prices using event-driven analysis. 
        We examine the relationship between the global COVID-19 pandemic and the stock prices of Pfizer Inc. 
        by investigating the impact of significant events, such as the WHO declaring a pandemic and the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
            
        The project involves multiple types of analyses:
        - **Regression Analysis:** We perform multiple linear regression to understand the relationships between stock prices and COVID-related variables.
        - **Event Impact Analysis:** We assess the direct impact of major events on stock returns.
        - **Logistic Regression & Random Forest:** We build models to classify stock movements and identify important features.

        The datasets used in this analysis include global COVID-19 case data and stock price data for Pfizer. These datasets are combined to enable the analysis of event-driven changes in stock behavior.
